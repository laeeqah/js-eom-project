                <h1>Mihlali Momoza</h1>
                <p>My experience with Laeeqah I can safely say that she's quiet and a self assertive individual, she proved herself to be a dependable candidate and a 
                    hard worker with solid problem solving and technical skills. I was always impressed by Laeeqahâ€™s ability to complete the work assigned to her on time. Laeeqah not only met deadlines 
                    but also explains her programs in a way that non-experts can easily understand.

                <p>Laeeqah is a hard-working young lady, focused on meeting her deadlines and goals.
                    She is easy to work with, displays a lot of maturity and respect, 
                    and clearly manages her work quite appropriately.
                    Laeeqah usually displays ethical conduct, and focus, and you can't beat that.
